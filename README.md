Developed a novel approach for highlight detection in match videos by utilizing wordnet-based word lists and
applying speech-to-text conversion, text preprocessing, vectorization, and cosine similarity metric measurement
to compare commentary audio transcripts.


Implemented parallel processing techniques to optimize the computation time of AI models, enhancing the
efficiency and throughput of the highlight detection model, especially for longer match videos.
